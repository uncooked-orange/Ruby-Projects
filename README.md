Simple Command Line Games Made in Ruby

Mastermind:
Mastermind is a game about guessing a sequence of colors. At first, a number of colors will be chosen at random and hidden, and you will be prompted to guess a sequence. The game will provide you with information such as the number of colors you've guessed correctly and the position of the colors that you have guessed correctly, making it easier for you to plan your next guess.

Tic-Tac-Toe:
This two-player game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbol, either "X" or "O." The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols. If all nine cells are filled without either player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.

Hangman:
Hangman is a game similar to Mastermind where you have to guess a word by making small guesses at which letters might be included in that word. This version uses a file with random words that the computer chooses from and has the added ability to save your guesses whenever you feel like finishing it later. You can only load up the last guess, though.
